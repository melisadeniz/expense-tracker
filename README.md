# Expense Tracker 💰

#### In this project, I built an Expense Budget Tracker. While I was building it, I used State Management in React. And I used styled-components for CSS. I also learned how to implement some graphics or charts to my react application using Chart.js. I used Vercel to deploy this application in the production environment. The biggest challenge I had during the development of this application is when I was creating the transactions component.

📌 You can add your any expense or income with the amount and description.  
📌 You can see the list of expenses and incomes.   
📌 You can search your expenses or incomes by their descriptions.  
📌 You can see the statistics of expenses and incomes in a Pie chart.
