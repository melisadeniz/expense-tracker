# Expense Tracker ðŸ’°

#### In this project, I built an Expense Budget Tracker. While I was building it, I used State Management in React. And I used styled-components for CSS. I also learned how to implement some graphics or charts to my react application using Chart.js. I used Vercel to deploy this application in the production environment. The biggest challenge I had during the development of this application is when I was creating the transactions component.

ðŸ“Œ You can add your any expense or income with the amount and description.  
ðŸ“Œ You can see the list of expenses and incomes.  
ðŸ“Œ You can search your expenses or incomes by their descriptions. 
ðŸ“Œ You can see the statistics of expenses and incomes in a Pie chart.
